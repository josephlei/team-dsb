NOTES

No violation observed at time of inspection.
Facility uses a Crescor "Hot Hold" cabinet to reheat prepackaged entrees or occasionally large trays of hot vegetables to be scooped into
paper trays. Unit appears to be for hot holding, rather than reheating. Beans in the holding cabinet measured at 77F after it was in unit for
~45 minutes. Unit was set at the maximum and the ambient was ~190F. Ensure manufacturer sealed foods or vegetables are reheated to
at least 135F within 2 hours. Contact 876-7885 or email fongshir@saccounty.net the final reheating temperature of the beans. If unit is
unable to reheat foods to the required temperatures within the timeframe, then another unit, such as the oven, shall be used to reheat
foods.
