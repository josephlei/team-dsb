FOOD PROTECTED FROM CONTAMINATION

OBSERVATIONS: Found (9) one dozen raw shell eggs packages to be overstocked inside of open face refrigeration unit on retail
market. Do not overstock any potentially hazardous foods (PHFs) inside of open face refrigeration unit as that will block the required
circulation of cold air needed to maintain the PHFs at proper holding temperatures. Corrected on site, education provided.

and condiments on display shall be protected from contamination by the use of dispensers, packaging, counter, service line, or sneeze
guards that intercept a direct line between the consumer's mouth and the food being displayed. Only prepackaged non-potentially
hazardous food or uncut produce may be displayed or sold outdoors if under overhead cover. Open-air barbecues shall be separated from
public access. (113984 (a-f), 113986, 114060, 114067, 114069, 114077, 114089.1 (c), 114143 (c-e))
