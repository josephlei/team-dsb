HANDWASHING PROCEDURES

OBSERVATIONS: One food worker observed cut raw chicken, wash his hands with soap and then wiped his hands on a wiping cloth
hanging from his apron. Use paper towels to dry just-washed hands. Corrected.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Employees are required to wash their hands in the following situations: before engaging in food preparation, after
touching bare skin, after using the toilet room, after coughing or sneezing, after eating, drinking, or using tobacco, after handling soiled
equipment or utensils, as often as necessary during food preparation to prevent cross-contamination, when switching from working with raw

HOT AND COLD HOLDING TEMPERATURES

OBSERVATIONS: Raw chicken, raw beef, raw pork and shrimps in overfilled cold inserts at cook's line were measured from 44 to 48
F using a thermocouple. Per manager, these items were taken out of the walk-in refrigerator earlier in the morning. These same
items were temped at 38 to 39 F inside the walk-in. Ambient air temperature inside the reach-in portion under the cold inserts was
measured at 41 F. Excess meat in inserts were moved back into the walk-in. Thermostat of the refrigeration unit was adjusted and
ambient air temperature inside the unit was measured at 36 F at end of inspection.
- See previous routine inspection in which the following corrective actions were written. Inserts should not be overfilled and
should be covered when not in use. Ensure that the refrigeration unit is cold enough to keep all contents at 41F or below at all times.
- SECOND REPEAT VIOLATION Note: If continued non-compliance, especially on food holding temperature violations, are still observed during the next routine
inspection, a charged reinspection will be conducted. It should be noted that this is a second chance granted, as the operator was
already forewarned on the last inspection report (8/21/2015) that a re-inspection would be done if non-compliance is still observed.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be
held at or below 45F: raw shell eggs, unshucked live molluscan shellfish, pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products in original sealed
containers, potentially hazardous foods held during transportation. Food preparation shall not exceed two cumulative hours without a return
to the required holding temperatures. (113996, 113998, 114037)

use with different type of raw food of animal origin, when changing from raw food to ready to eat food, between uses with raw produce and
potentially hazardous food, before using a thermometer, any time during the operation when contamination may have occurred.
Food-contact surfaces and utensils shall be clean to sight and touch. (114113, 114115, 114117, 114125(b), 114141)
