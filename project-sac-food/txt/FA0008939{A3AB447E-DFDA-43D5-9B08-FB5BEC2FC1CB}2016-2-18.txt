PLUMBING FIXTURES AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION

OBSERVATIONS: Drain pipe from the prep sink has been directly connected to the waste line in the floor sink below. This sink is
required to have a minimum of a 1 inch air gap between the end of the drain pipe and the top of the floor sink (floor level.) The blue
area appears to be appropriate as a dividing line - remove the pipe below the blue stripe or use another method to comply. Repeat
violation - correct within 1 week.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Steam tables, ice machines, ice bins, food preparation sinks, display cases, walk-in refrigeration units, and other
similar equipment that discharge liquid waste shall drain into a floor sink with an air gap or other approved type of receptor. Plumbing and
plumbing fixtures shall be maintained so as to prevent contamination, shall be kept clean, fully operative, and in good repair. The potable
water supply shall be protected with a backflow or back siphonage protection device. Any hose used for potable water shall be of approved
materials, labeled, properly stored, and used for no other purpose. (114171, 114190, 114192, 114193, 114193.1, 114199, 114201, 114269)

NOTES

The Y-fitting on the mop sink faucet has a hose attached. This can cause a backflow of chemical into the building's potable water system IF
the atmospheric vacuum breaker fails. Atmospheric vacuum breakers can fail, undetected, if the hose is turned off an on at the Y-fitting and
not the faucets.
Always use the faucet's hot and cold water above the atmospheric vacuum breaker OR use an approved anti-siphon device such as on the
handouts. Currently, staff uses only the faucet's hot and cold water above the vacuum breaker. See handouts.
Emergency food is stored in a separate building.
Provided shed policy and information on atmospheric vacuum breakers/back flow prevention.
