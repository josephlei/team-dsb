NOTES

Reinspection conducted to follow up on cockroach infestation observed during inspection/reinspections dated 10-01-15, 10-06-15, and
10-09-15. Facility was last serviced by Ecolab pest control on 10-12-15 and will be serviced weekly for one month. No live cockroaches
were observed at time of reinspection. Health permit is reinstated. Continue with aggressive pest control treatment and monitor all areas
for signs of activity. Seal all areas noted with gaps and holes (cook's line, warewash area, storage areas, back kitchen, near back doors,
etc.). Use approved sealer to seal all gaps so surfaces can be smooth and easily washable (expending foam is not approved). Maintain
daily cleaning and sanitation of facility to prevent vermin harborage. Grout between floor tiles and around cove base tiles in multiple areas
of the kitchen.
Facility will be reinspected within 14 days to verify compliance with all major violations noted on routine inspection report dated 10-01-15.
