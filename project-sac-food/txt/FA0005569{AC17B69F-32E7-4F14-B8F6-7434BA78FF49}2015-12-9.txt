NOTES

School has a food recycle bin. Students that go through the salad bar are required to take a fruit and vegetable. If they do not want it they
can place it into this recycle bin for other students to take what they want. The food can be taken back to classrooms or home. Milk is
also placed in this bin and it is not under temperature control or Time as a Public Health Control (TPHC). This also occurs at breakfast
where the kids have their back packs with them and the food can be placed in the bag to be consumed later. This will be discussed with
a supervisor and outcome will be communicated with the district.
