HOT AND COLD HOLDING TEMPERATURES

OBSERVATIONS: The following potentially hazardous food items were stored at improper holding temperature:
- Foods at hot bar stored between 106F-132F: asiago chicken, braised cabbage, chicken wings, sriracho wings, bbq chicken, teriyaki
vegetables, steamed broccoli, butternut squash, mashed potatoes, paleo mushrooms, corn, and spanish rice. (Note that there was
no water at steam table beneath braised cabbage, chicken wings, paleo mushrooms, corn, and spanish rice.) Containers used are
shallow and there is low amount of water inside hot bar steam tables. Food was placed on line after 11am. Food was reheated
above 165F during inspection.
- Chicken breast for asiago chicken 116F and pork ribs 126F-132F inside warmer unit located between hoods. Chicken was cooked
at 11am and employees were not aware what time pork ribs were cooked. Both food items were voluntarily discarded during
inspection.
- Foods inside open air cooler: tamales 47F-55F, spinach polani 54F, Sukhi's chicken 50F, turkey club sandwich 44F-48F, and pasta
44F. Temperature was blowing at 55F and then dropped to blow at 33F. Per maintenance, this unit was on defrost cycle at 3pm.
Some food items were voluntarily discarded during inspection (see VC&D) and some were relocated inside another cooler.
Minor Violation
- Food items at chef's cold case were stored between 43F- 46F: meatballs, salmon, citrus salmon, chicken curry, various quinoa
salads, sonoma chicken, and asparagus salads. Per maintenance, this cold display was on defrost cycle. Ambient temperature
dropped from 45F to 41F during inspection. Set up this cooler to colder setting to ensure all food stored at/below 41F at all times.
- Salad bar cold top cooler: sliced turkey 43F-46F, boiled eggs 44F-50F, corn 44F, tofu 44F-50F, sliced melon 44F. Also, pinto beans
and peas 44F stored at reach-in cooler beneath salad bar cooler. Food items have been relocated inside walk-in cooler.
Potentially hazardous foods may not be stored at room temperature unless time as a public health control (TPHC) is used. Store
foods at/below 41F or at/above 135F at all times. Foods stored in units that under defrost cycle must be maintained at required
temperature range. Do not overfill insert fill containers; store about 3/4 full. Do not overstock foods at open air coolers (recommend
storing only in one layer to provide proper air flow throughout the unit). Turn some coolers to colder settings to ensure all food
stored at/below 41F. Routinely stir food items at hot bar and ensure there is enough hot water at provided steam tables. (Highly
recommend storing hot food items inside deeper inserts at hot bar.) REPEAT VIOLATION

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be
held at or below 45F: raw shell eggs, unshucked live molluscan shellfish, pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products in original sealed
containers, potentially hazardous foods held during transportation. Food preparation shall not exceed two cumulative hours without a return
to the required holding temperatures. (113996, 113998, 114037)
