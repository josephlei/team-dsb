NOTES

No food is prepared in the service kitchen. All lunches are prepared by the Twin Rivers Unified School District. All food is pre-packaged
and placed in a closed bag or clam shell. During the lunch service a representative with the school places the lunches on the table and
students grab what they want and sign for it. Lunches are kept in the commercial 2 door stand up refrigerator. There is a hand washing
sink and buckets available for quaternary ammonia to sanitize tables before and after lunch service. Any lunches that are left over are
discarded.
5712 Dudley Blvd Building has an elementary K-6th attached to the district office. It is the same operation as the independent study at
