steam table was accidentally turned off somehow. These were reheated to over 165 F during the inspection.
b. Sliced tomatoes and sliced cheese (mozzarella and cheddar) in inserts on prep cold top were measured from 47 to 52 F.
Tomatoes and cheese were moved inside thereach-in portion of the cold top (ambient temperature: 38 F). This has been a chronic

required to be refrigerated. The pH of facility-made ranch dressing and Italian sauce were barely below 4.6 and storing them at 41 F
or below was recommended. Parmesan cheese does not need to be refrigerated due to low water activity.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be
