NOTES

Facility uses Time as a Public Health Control (TPHC) for all baked items that are potentially hazardous foods (PHFs) stored inside display
cases. Baker prepares dough and then places meatballs, hot dogs, raw bacon, raw egg, etc. on dough before placing inside Crescor hot
holding units held at 70-80F. The dough is allowed to ferment and rise for 45 minutes with PHFs raising in temperature also. The items are
then placed inside oven to bake the dough.
This process is approved, but facility must begin tracking time on TPHC log at the earliest time that a PHF is removed from temperature
control. Facility currently only tracks items on log once they are removed from the oven and placed in the display case. Education provided
through an interpreter.
