OBSERVATIONS: Observed an employee place floor mats onto the floor and then swap the contaminated gloves out for new ones
without washing her hands. Gloves were discarded and hands were washed.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Employees shall minimize bare hand contact with nonprepackaged ready-to-eat food. Single-use gloves shall be used
for only one task and shall be discarded when damaged or soiled, or when interruptions in the food handling occur. Gloves shall be changed
as often as handwashing is required. Slash-resistant gloves may be used with ready-to-eat food if the gloves have a smooth, durable,
nonabsorbent surface, or are covered with a single-use glove. (113961, 113973 (b,c,e))

HOT AND COLD WATER SUPPLY

OBSERVATIONS: Hot water at the 3 comp sink at 114F. Keep at 120F or more at all times.

CODE DESCRIPTION: An adequate, protected, pressurized, potable supply of hot and cold water shall be provided at all times. Hot water
shall be supplied at a minimum temperature of at least 120F when measured from the faucet. The temperature of water provided to
handwashing facilities shall be at least 100F. Handwashing facilities equipped with auto run faucets shall have their water temperature set
between 100F to 108F. (113953(c), 114101(d), 114189, 114192, 114192.1, 114195)

approved location within the fully enclosed permitted food facility. Clean equipment, utensils, linens, and single-use articles shall not be
exposed to splash, dust, vermin or other forms of contamination. Non-food items shall be stored and displayed separate from food and
food-contact surfaces. During pauses in food preparation utensils shall be stored with handles above the top of the food, on a clean sanitized
surface, in running water, or in water that is at least 135F. Single-use articles and multiservice utensils shall be handled, displayed, and
dispensed so that contamination of food and lip-contact surfaces is prevented. Pressurized cylinders shall be securely fastened to rigid
