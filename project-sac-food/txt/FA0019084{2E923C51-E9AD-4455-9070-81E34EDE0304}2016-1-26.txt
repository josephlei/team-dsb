WAREWASHING AND SANITIZING PROCEDURES

OBSERVATIONS: Employee observed taking a blender pitcher direct from the third compartment of the warewash sink and was
stopped just before he was to use the wet pitcher to prepare coffee. Always follow the required steps when warewashing: Wash Rinse - Sanitize - Air Dry. Using pitchers which are still wet with sanitizer will result in denaturing the food items. Mitigated by
having the employee thoroughly dry the pitcher with clean paper towels.
- It was recommended to the Director that the facility be provided with more pitchers to allow employees to air-dry these before
re-using them.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Food-contact surfaces and multiservice utensils shall be effectively washed, rinsed, and sanitized to remove or
completely loosen soils by use of manual or mechanical methods. The temperature of the washing solution shall be maintained at least
100F or at the temperature specified by the manufacturer's label. Manual sanitation shall be accomplished during the final rinse by contact
with solution containing 100 ppm available chlorine or 200 ppm quaternary ammonium. Mechanical sanitization shall be accomplished in
the final rinse by achieving a utensil surface temperature of 160F or by contact with solution containing 50 ppm available chlorine. After
cleaning and sanitizing, equipment and utensils shall be air dried. (114097, 114099.1, 114099.2, 114099.4, 114099.6, 114099.7, 114101

VENTILATION AND LIGHTING

and building department. Canopy-type hoods shall extend six inches beyond all cooking equipment. All areas shall have sufficient
ventilation to facilitate proper food storage. Toilet rooms shall be vented to the outside air by a screened openable window, air shaft, or
light-switch activated exhaust fan. Adequate lighting shall be provided in all areas to facilitate cleaning and inspection. Light fixtures in
areas where open food is stored, served, prepared, and where utensils are washed shall be of shatterproof construction or protected with
light shields. (114149, 114149.1, 114149.2, 114149.3, 114252, 114252.1)

or other suitable facilities shall be provided and used for the orderly storage of employee clothing and other possessions. Lockers or other
