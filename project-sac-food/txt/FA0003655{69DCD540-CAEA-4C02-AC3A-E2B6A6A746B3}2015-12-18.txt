HOT AND COLD HOLDING TEMPERATURES

OBSERVATIONS: Hot holding on the end (closest do dinning room) is not adequate to hold foods at or above 135 deg. F. Observed
the following temperatures:
1. Goat curry at 126 deg. F

was removed from temperature control at "A" hours and must be DISCARDED at "B" hours, where " B " is 4 hours after removing
from adequate temperature control. This restaurant is open from 11:30 to 2:30, 3 hours so this procedure may work well If you are

Decide which course you will take - keeping food at 135 deg. F or higher or using TPHC within 3 days. Then do whichever you
prefer.
