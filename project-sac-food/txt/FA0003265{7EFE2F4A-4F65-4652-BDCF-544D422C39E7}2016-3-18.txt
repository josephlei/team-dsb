FOOD PROTECTED FROM CONTAMINATION

OBSERVATIONS: 1. Salt and dried chilis (3 containers) stored uncovered in the storage room when not in use. Provide tight fitting
lids to protect foods from contamination within 3 days.
2. Torn blue washing cloths stored in direct contact with food, where particles of terry cloth can disintegrate into the food. Torn
terry cloth is not an approved food contact surface. Discontinue using torn cloths in contact with food immediately.
3. Onions on the floor in the storage room. Put into the onion bin today.
4. Raw marinating chicken in a bus tub above beef. This can cause chicken to drip to beef and cause foodborne illness. Keep raw
poultry products below beef prodcuts. Correct within 2 days.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Food shall be protected from contamination during transportation, storage, preparation, holding, and display. Food
and condiments on display shall be protected from contamination by the use of dispensers, packaging, counter, service line, or sneeze guards
that intercept a direct line between the consumer's mouth and the food being displayed. Only prepackaged non-potentially hazardous food or
uncut produce may be displayed or sold outdoors if under overhead cover. Open-air barbecues shall be separated from public access.
