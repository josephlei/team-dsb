NOTES

This facility shares garbage bins with others in the mall, including other restaurants. You are required to keep bin lids closed. I spoke with
Brett, the Operations Manager at Republic (916) 631-0600 who discussed the problem of the bins being opened and then pushed back into
the enclosure so that the lids cannot be closed. I've advised the other restaurants to contact Brett should this issue arise again. Please
contact Brett if the lids are placed between the wall and the bin so they can not be closed, in the future.
