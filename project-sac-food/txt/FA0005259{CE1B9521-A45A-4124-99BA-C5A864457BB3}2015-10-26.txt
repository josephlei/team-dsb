NOTES

No violations at the time of inspection. Thank-you!
Note: garbage dumpster lids open. This can cause waste product to run into storm drains, especially during rain, contaminating drinking
water, and causes vermin such as flies and rats. The garbage company has put the bins into the walled area with the lids open and against
the wall, making the lids impossible to close without removing the bins. Recommend contacting garbage disposal and discussing closing
bin lids prior to placing back into the walled area.
