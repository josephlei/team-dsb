HOT AND COLD HOLDING TEMPERATURES

OBSERVATIONS: MAJOR VIOLATIONS:
Upper layers of sliced tomatoes being cold held over ice in the inoperable right side refrigeration unit at make line were measured at
55 F using a thermocouple. When using ice to cold hold, do not simply put the food item(s) on top of the ice. Make sure the level of
the ice around the food container is at least the same as that of the food item. Since the sliced tomatoes were the only PHF in the
right side refrigeration unit at the make line, the insert was moved to the left side make line refrigeration unit during the inspection.
Upper layers of the portioned pastrami and cold cuts in inserts on the left side make line refrigeration unit were temped at 52 to 55 F.
The portions on the upper layers of these inserts were moved into the upright refrigerator (ambient temp inside: 38 F) during the
inspection.
Minor Violations:
Other PHFs in inserts on the left side make line refrigeration unit (including but not limited to ham, turkey, chicken, Philly steak,
shredded cheese were measure at 43 to 47 F. Ambient air temperature under the inserts was measured at 36 F. This unit is just
about five feet from the oven (constantly in use at time of inspection) and was observed being left open even when not in use. Close
the unit when not in use.
Potentially hazardous food (PHF) items in the walk-in refrigerator were temped at up to 50 F using a thermocouple. Operator stated
that she discovered this when she came in at noon. A refrigeration technician was already on site when inspector arrived at the
facility. Technician stated that there is serious ice buildup in the condender adn this needs to be defrosted before he can fix the
unit. PHFs were moved into the upright refrigerator (ambient air temperature inside: 38 F) during the inspection. Fax proof of
correction to EMD [Attn: Bo Faustino] at (916) 875-8513 within 24 hours to avoid a charged reinspection. Do not store potentially
hazardous foods in it until it is capable of keeping contents at 41F or below.
