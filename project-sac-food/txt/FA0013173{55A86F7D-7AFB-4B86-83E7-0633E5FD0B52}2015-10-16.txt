NOTES

*NOTE:
-Floating sushi boats - Sushi rolls and potentially hazardous foods such as edamame are made during lunch and dinner and set on floating
boats at room temperature until picked up by a patron. With noted process, temperatures will increase due to the lack of temperature
control. A source of temperature control (ex. ice/refrigerator) and time control (Time as a Public Health Control) was not available during
inspection. Sushi area was closed when inspection started in area.
-Facility will now utilize time control for process. A hand written procedure with listings for all sushi products that may be set at room
temperature will be created and displayed in sushi area. Items are typically made and set out at 11:30am and the restaurant is closed at
2pm during lunch. Dinner is from 5-9pm. These items noted in written procedures shall be sold/served or discarded within a 4 hour time
limit. Process shall begin immediately.
Per Head Cook, a plate of California roll is typically stationed at room temperature in kitchen and served on bento boxes. Ensure items are
listed on hand written procedures or a time stamp/log is available for product.
