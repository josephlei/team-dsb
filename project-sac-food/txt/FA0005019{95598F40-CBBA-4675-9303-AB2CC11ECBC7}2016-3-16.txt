WAREWASHING AND SANITIZING PROCEDURES

OBSERVATIONS: Maximum temperature measured in high temp dish machine (even after 3 cycles) using maximum registering
thermometer was 91 F. Per employee, no warewashing has been conducted today (none observed during the inspection). Per store
manager, she was not aware of this problem and she will call this in immediately. Correct within 3 days. Fax proof of correction

to avoid a reinspection with a corresponding reinspection fee.

the inspection. All dishware shall be washed, rinsed and sanitized manually until the dish machine is repaired. Air dry dishware
after minimum contact time of 60 seconds in the sanitizing solution.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Food-contact surfaces and multiservice utensils shall be effectively washed, rinsed, and sanitized to remove or
completely loosen soils by use of manual or mechanical methods. The temperature of the washing solution shall be maintained at least
100F or at the temperature specified by the manufacturer's label. Manual sanitation shall be accomplished during the final rinse by contact
with solution containing 100 ppm available chlorine or 200 ppm quaternary ammonium. Mechanical sanitization shall be accomplished in
the final rinse by achieving a utensil surface temperature of 160F or by contact with solution containing 50 ppm available chlorine. After
cleaning and sanitizing, equipment and utensils shall be air dried. (114097, 114099.1, 114099.2, 114099.4, 114099.6, 114099.7, 114101

WAREWASHING FACILITIES AND TESTING METHODS

OBSERVATIONS: No thema-labels or maximum registering thermometer available at the warewash area. Manager stated that they

available to employees and test high-temp dish machine regularly (see related Violation #14b).
