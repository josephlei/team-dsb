WAREWASHING AND SANITIZING PROCEDURES

OBSERVATIONS: QA 150: CalCode requires 200 ppm quaternary ammonia to be used for manual sanitization. There is no
exemption to this except section 114099.6 (c) which states that manual sanitization can be accomplished using “other methods
approved by the enforcement agency.”
Sacramento EMD does not accept manufacturer’s instructions but requires 200 ppm when using QA for sanitizers in food facilities,
even if per manufacturer's instructions.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Food-contact surfaces and multiservice utensils shall be effectively washed, rinsed, and sanitized to remove or
completely loosen soils by use of manual or mechanical methods. The temperature of the washing solution shall be maintained at least 100F
or at the temperature specified by the manufacturer's label. Manual sanitation shall be accomplished during the final rinse by contact with
solution containing 100 ppm available chlorine or 200 ppm quaternary ammonium. Mechanical sanitization shall be accomplished in the final
rinse by achieving a utensil surface temperature of 160F or by contact with solution containing 50 ppm available chlorine. After cleaning and
sanitizing, equipment and utensils shall be air dried. (114097, 114099.1, 114099.2, 114099.4, 114099.6, 114099.7, 114101 (b-d), 114105,
114109, 114111)

NONFOOD-CONTACT SURFACES CLEAN

OBSERVATIONS: Floor sink below the front soda fountain has some mold/mildew build up. Clean to prevent blockage within 14
days.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Nonfood-contact surfaces of equipment shall be kept free of an accumulation of dust, dirt, food residue, and other
debris. Interior premises of a food facility shall be kept clean. (114115 (b), 114257)

# 41

PLUMBING FIXTURES AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION

OBSERVATIONS: Observed hose with spray nozzle on the mop sink, after "Y" fitting. Atmospheric vacuum breaker protects the
potable water supply. However the atmospheric vacuum breaker can undergo undetected wear and not protect the water supply
when under constant pressure.
Provide an approved anti-siphon device (see handouts) OR remove hose after each use. Correct within 30 days.
Provided City of Wichita handout and EMD handout.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Steam tables, ice machines, ice bins, food preparation sinks, display cases, walk-in refrigeration units, and other
similar equipment that discharge liquid waste shall drain into a floor sink with an air gap or other approved type of receptor. Plumbing and
plumbing fixtures shall be maintained so as to prevent contamination, shall be kept clean, fully operative, and in good repair. The potable
water supply shall be protected with a backflow or back siphonage protection device. Any hose used for potable water shall be of approved
materials, labeled, properly stored, and used for no other purpose. (114171, 114190, 114192, 114193, 114193.1, 114199, 114201, 114269)
