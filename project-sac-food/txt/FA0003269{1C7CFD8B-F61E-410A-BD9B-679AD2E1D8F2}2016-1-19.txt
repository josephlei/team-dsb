COOLING METHODS

OBSERVATIONS: Observed a large pot of bone soup, greater then 15 gallons, stored at room temperature in the kitchen at 81 deg.
F (room temp about 78 deg. F.) Per staff, this was made about 2 hours ago, allowed to cool at room temp and then moved into the
refrigerator or freezer in the large container.
Food facility staff must QUICKLY cool hot foods from 135 deg. F to 71 deg. F within 2 hours. If time does not meet this then you
must discard to protect your patrons. From 71 deg. F then cool to 41 deg. F within an additional 4 hours. Leaving food in a warm
room will not adequately or quickly cool foods.
Recommend breaking into smaller pots/storage containers (more surface area will cool quicker) or using a cooling paddle or
adding ice after cooking, or other quick chill methods. See handout. Correct immediately.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be rapidly cooled from 135F to 70F within 2 hours, and then from 70F to 41F within
4 hours. Cooling shall be by one or more of the following methods: in shallow containers, separating food into smaller portions, adding ice as
an ingredient, using an ice bath, stirring frequently, using rapid cooling equipment, or using containers that facilitate heat transfer. (114002,
