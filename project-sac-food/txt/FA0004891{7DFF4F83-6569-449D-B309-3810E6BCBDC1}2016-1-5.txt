NOTES

Important Note:
Several violations observed today are repeat violations (a number for multiple times) which were already written up during past
inspection(s). For just the most recent routine inspection, nine of the eleven violations written up then (~ 3-1/2 months ago) were still
observed today. If this pattern of continued non-compliance of operator is still observed at the next routine inspection, it shall result
enforcement actions which were discussed with the supervisors. Most important, there should be no major violations on food
temperature holding which has been a chronic issue with this facility.
