PLUMBING FIXTURES AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION

OBSERVATIONS: Mop sink has a Y-fitting below the atmospheric vacuum breaker. This can cause water to stay in the faucet
between the Y-fitting and the vacuum breaker, causing the vacuum breaker to fail, undetected. Provide anti-siphon device between
y-fitting and hose OR remove Y-fitting after use, within 14 days. See handout.

similar equipment that discharge liquid waste shall drain into a floor sink with an air gap or other approved type of receptor. Plumbing and
plumbing fixtures shall be maintained so as to prevent contamination, shall be kept clean, fully operative, and in good repair. The potable
water supply shall be protected with a backflow or back siphonage protection device. Any hose used for potable water shall be of approved
materials, labeled, properly stored, and used for no other purpose. (114171, 114190, 114192, 114193, 114193.1, 114199, 114201, 114269)
