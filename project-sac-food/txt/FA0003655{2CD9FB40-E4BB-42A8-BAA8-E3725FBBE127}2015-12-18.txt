HOT AND COLD HOLDING TEMPERATURES

OBSERVATIONS: Hot holding on the end (closest do dinning room) is not adequate to hold foods at or above 135 deg. F. Observed
the following temperatures:
1. Goat curry at 126 deg. F
2. Chicken at 111 deg. F
3. Rice at 112 deg. F.
Either hold hot foods at or above 135 deg. F OR use Time-as-a-Public-Health-Control (TPHC). TPHC must be documented - that food
was removed from temperature control at "A" hours and must be DISCARDED at "B" hours, where "B" is 4 hours after removing
from adequate temperature control. This restaurant is open from 11:30 to 2:30, 3 hours so this procedure may work well if you are
willing to discard food at 2:30. However documentation is required.
Decide which course you will take - keeping food at 135 deg. F or higher or using TPHC within 3 days. Then do whichever you
prefer.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be
held at or below 45F: raw shell eggs, unshucked live molluscan shellfish, pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products in original sealed
containers, potentially hazardous foods held during transportation. Food preparation shall not exceed two cumulative hours without a return
to the required holding temperatures. (113996, 113998, 114037)

Routine

Items listed on this report as violations do not meet the requirements set forth in the California Health and Safety Code commencing with section 7; 113700. All
violations must be corrected within specified timeframe. Violations that are classified as "Major" pose an immediate threat to public health and have the potential
to cause foodborne illness. All major violations must be corrected immediately. Non-compliance may warrant immediate closure of the food facility.

OBSERVATIONS: Observed the following foods cooling on a rack in the storage room with a fan.
1. Rice at 138 deg. F in the center but 110 deg. F on the edges
2. Cooked vegatables in oil in a pot at 81 deg. F
3. Tomato product (non-phf due to high acidity) at 138 deg. F
4. Curry chicken, with a pan of ice floating inside at 145 deg. F
5. Baked potatos on a tray, these were removed from the oven when I entered so I did not take the temperature.
Per owner, all these foods were cooked and removed from stove/temperature control 20 minutes ago.
ENSURE that foods are foods cool from 135 to 70 deg F within 2 hours. MONITOR temperature using a probe thermometer. After
reaching 70 deg. F within 2 hours, you then have 4 hours to cool from 69 deg. F to 41 deg. F.
Note: Foods will not cool to 70 deg. F, even with fan, if room is 73 deg. F (ambient temperature).
RECOMMEND placing these foods in ice baths, where the hight of the ice is equal to or exceeds the food in the pan - not just the
bottom few inches, or using ice paddles.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be rapidly cooled from 135F to 70F within 2 hours, and then from 70F to 41F within
4 hours. Cooling shall be by one or more of the following methods: in shallow containers, separating food into smaller portions, adding ice
as an ingredient, using an ice bath, stirring frequently, using rapid cooling equipment, or using containers that facilitate heat transfer.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Employees shall not commit any act that may cause the contamination or adulteration of food or food contact
surfaces. Food shall be produced, prepared, stored, transported, and served, so as to be free from adulteration and spoilage. Food is

Containers previously used to store poisonous or toxic materials shall not be used to store food, utensils, or single-use articles. Utensils
used for tasting shall be discarded or washed, rinsed, and sanitized between tastings. Ice used as a medium for cooling food and
beverages shall not be offered for consumption. Food shall be inspected upon receipt and prior to any use, storage, or resale. (113967,
