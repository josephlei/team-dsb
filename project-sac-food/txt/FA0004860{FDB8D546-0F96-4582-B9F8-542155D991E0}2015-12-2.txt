HOT AND COLD WATER SUPPLY

OBSERVATIONS: Handwash sink faucets were dispensing pre-mixed water measured at 117 F (food prep area) and 120 F (back
area). Handwash sinks where there are no separate hot and cold valves shall provide warm water at least 100 F but no higher than
108 F. Corrected during the inspection.
- SECOND REPEAT VIOLATION - (observed and written up during the last three routine inspections)
Note: Check water temperature at handwash sinks regularly. If the water is too hot, food workers are likely to be discouraged from
washing their hands properly. Handwashing by employees should be made not only possible, but also likely.

CODE DESCRIPTION: An adequate, protected, pressurized, potable supply of hot and cold water shall be provided at all times. Hot water
shall be supplied at a minimum temperature of at least 120F when measured from the faucet. The temperature of water provided to
handwashing facilities shall be at least 100F. Handwashing facilities equipped with auto run faucets shall have their water temperature set
between 100F to 108F. (113953(c), 114101(d), 114189, 114192, 114192.1, 114195)

CODE DESCRIPTION: Exhaust hoods shall be provided to remove toxic gases, heat, grease, vapors and smoke and be approved by health
and building department. Canopy-type hoods shall extend six inches beyond all cooking equipment. All areas shall have sufficient
ventilation to facilitate proper food storage. Toilet rooms shall be vented to the outside air by a screened openable window, air shaft, or
light-switch activated exhaust fan. Adequate lighting shall be provided in all areas to facilitate cleaning and inspection. Light fixtures in
