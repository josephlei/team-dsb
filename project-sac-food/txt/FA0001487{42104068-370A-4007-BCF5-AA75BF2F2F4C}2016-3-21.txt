a cooling food item will lengthen the time required to cool the food item and it will warm the food in the top container. Correct
immediately.

4 hours. Cooling shall be by one or more of the following methods: in shallow containers, separating food into smaller portions, adding ice
as an ingredient, using an ice bath, stirring frequently, using rapid cooling equipment, or using containers that facilitate heat transfer.
