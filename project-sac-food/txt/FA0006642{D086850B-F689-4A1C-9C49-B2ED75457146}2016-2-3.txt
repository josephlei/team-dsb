COOLING METHODS

MAJOR

OBSERVATIONS: Potato salad, spaghetti and macaroni pasta, all cooked yesterday, were found being improperly cooled in large
closed containers inside the larger walk-in refrigerator. Au jus which was cooked about one hour before (per manager) in large
container (approximately 25 gallons) was found with one ice paddle (ice inside was already all melted) was temped at 92 F. Some of
the au jus was moved into another container and ice was added to both containers. The other food items were voluntarily discarded
by the operator during the inspection (see VC&D below).
Notes:
a. Recommendations made to the operator were to have their staff re-trained on approved cooling procedures, having a dedicated
probe thermometer inside the walk-in refrigerator so staff can take food temperatures regularly and to provide more ice paddles
(facility has only one ice paddle).
b. This was a major violation already observed and written up during the last routine inspection. If this is still observed in future
inspections, further enforcement action(s), including mandatory charged reinspection(s), shall apply.
- REPEAT VIOLATION -

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be rapidly cooled from 135F to 70F within 2 hours, and then from 70F to 41F within
4 hours. Cooling shall be by one or more of the following methods: in shallow containers, separating food into smaller portions, adding ice
as an ingredient, using an ice bath, stirring frequently, using rapid cooling equipment, or using containers that facilitate heat transfer.
