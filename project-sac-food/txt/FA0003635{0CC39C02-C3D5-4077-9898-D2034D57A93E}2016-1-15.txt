GARBAGE AND REFUSE DISPOSAL

OBSERVATIONS: Shared garbage dumpster outside was found with lids opened. Work with co-tenants and/or landlord to always
keep lids closed when not being filled to prevent vermin infestation and possible dirty water (leachate) run-off to storm water drain.
Close garbage dumpster lids as soon as possible today.

CODE DESCRIPTION: The exterior premises of a food facility shall be kept free of litter and rubbish. All food waste and rubbish shall be
kept in nonabsorbent, durable, cleanable, leak-proof, and rodent-proof containers. Containers shall have close-fitting lids and be covered at

other conditions that attract or harbor insects or rodents. (114244, 114245, 114245.1, 114245.2, 114245.3, 114245.4, 114245.5, 114245.6,
