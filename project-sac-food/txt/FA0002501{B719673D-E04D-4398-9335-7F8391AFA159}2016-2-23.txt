NOTES

1. Facility uses a two-compartment sink as the hand sink in the main food prep area. The left compartment of this sink is equipped with a
garbage disposal unit and is sometimes used for soaking dirty utensils. It was also observed during the inspection that an employee was
actively washing/scrubbing a pot using the left compartment of the sink. It was strongly recommended to the supervisor that the
compartment on the right side be designated as exclusively for use for handwashing, Maintenance also agreed to move the soap and
paper towel dispensers to the right side of the sink. Handwashing by employees should be made not only possible, but also likely.
2. The requirement for any potentially hazardous food that has been cooked, cooled and subsequently reheated for hot holding to be
reheated to a temperature of 165°F for at least 15 seconds was discussed with the supervisor. Reheating stickers were provided.
- Note: It was also learned that leftovers are sometimes cooled (in an approved manner, per discussion) and reheated the following day.
