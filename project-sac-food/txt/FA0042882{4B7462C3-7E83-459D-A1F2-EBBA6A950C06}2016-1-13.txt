HOT AND COLD HOLDING TEMPERATURES

OBSERVATIONS: Found the cold top with all the deli meats holding all potentially hazardous food items stored at or between
45-46F. NOTE: Unit had 2-4" gaps between plastic inserts. Provide dividers to seal openings to prevent cold air from escaping
continuously. Also unit was set to a colder setting of 5. Monitor the ambient air of the unit after the openings are sealed to
ensure it doesn't freeze the unit. Ambient air shall be around 35-36F below. Also lower the levels of each item below the
predesignated lines on each pan for proper cold holding temperatures.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be
held at or below 45F: raw shell eggs, unshucked live molluscan shellfish, pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products in original sealed
containers, potentially hazardous foods held during transportation. Food preparation shall not exceed two cumulative hours without a return to
the required holding temperatures. (113996, 113998, 114037)

in nonabsorbent, durable, cleanable, leak-proof, and rodent-proof containers. Containers shall have close-fitting lids and be covered at all
times. All waste must be removed and disposed of as frequently as necessary to prevent the development of objectionable odors and other
conditions that attract or harbor insects or rodents. (114244, 114245, 114245.1, 114245.2, 114245.3, 114245.4, 114245.5, 114245.6,

that meets minimum standards. The walls and ceiling shall be smooth, durable, nonabsorbent, and easily cleanable. Flooring and base coving
