APPROPRIATE USE OF EQUIPMENT

OBSERVATIONS: Current location of hand sink is in a tight corner at the cooks line and not immediately accessible for other
employees if cooks line area is in use. Due to food preparation (including handling of raw meats) occurring near the prep sink/back
kitchen area and lack of an immediate, accessible hand sink in the area, an additional hand sink is required. Note: A small space is
available next to the prep sink and underused cold drawer station (in disrepair and used for dry storage). Conduct research and
contact 876-7885 to notify of plans and feasibility within 30 days.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Employees shall not clean their hands in a sink used for food preparation, warewashing, or in a service sink or a
curbed cleaning facility used for the disposal of mop water and similar liquid waste. A handwashing facility shall not be used for purposes
other than handwashing. Food preparation sinks, handwashing lavatories, and warewashing equipment shall not be used for the cleaning of
maintenance tools, the preparation or holding of maintenance materials, or the disposal of mop water and similar liquid wastes. Open-air
barbecue or outdoor wood-burning oven shall be operated on the same premises as, in reasonable proximity to, and in conjunction with, a
permanent food facility that is approved for food preparation. (113953.1 (b-d), 114123, 114143 (a,b), Exception 114125)
