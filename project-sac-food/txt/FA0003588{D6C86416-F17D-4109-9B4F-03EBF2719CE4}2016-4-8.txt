NOTES

A reinspection was conducted today based on major violations observed during routine inspection conducted on April 7, 2016. Major
violations including lack of shellfish identification tags, food surfaces not being cleaned/sanitized, and lack of toilet paper in women's

Toilet paper is provided in both restrooms in dispenser. Sanitizing solution was not available at beginning of inspection, but employee
bought bleach and set up sanitizing solution during inspection.
Most minor violations that were supposed to be corrected by today have not been corrected. An additional reinspection may be conducted
due to ongoing non-compliance with violations noted. Reinspection fees of $268 may apply. Ensure all violations are addressed within given
time frames. See inspection report.
