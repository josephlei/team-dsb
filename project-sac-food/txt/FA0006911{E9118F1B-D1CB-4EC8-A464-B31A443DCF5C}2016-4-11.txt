NOTES

This reinspection was conducted to ensure that the cockroach infestation observed in the facility has been corrected. Facility’s
professional pest control service has made two non-repellent chemical applications since the closure. Pest control company
representative stated that they are scheduled to do a third application later this week. Fourteen monitoring traps have also been placed in
strategic locations throughout the facility.
Operator has cleaned up food and grease buildup on equipment, shelving and floors. Per manager, all food contact surfaces have been
cleaned and sanitized after the second pesticide application. No more evidence of infestation was observed today.
No food out of temperature or other major violations were observed today. Small gaps/holes were shown to the manager and these need
to be sealed as soon as possible. For other uncorrected minor violations, if any, see official inspection report dated 4/7/2016 for
corrective actions and time frames for correction. Per manager, their district inspector will be doing another reinspection about two
weeks from reopening to ensure continued compliance.
