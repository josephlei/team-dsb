NOTES

Notes:
1. Dumpster lids open. Per operator, he closes lids after taking trash out when lids are not between dumpster and wall.
2. Operator maintaining food handler cards within each employee file. When I asked operator to separate records of employee food
handler cards from employee personal information, I observed that operator folded files to separate personal information from records of
food handler cards. Recommend separating records of employee food handler cards from employee personal information to protect
employee personal information. Records maintained in personnel files may be determined to be non-compliant by this department due to
privacy concerns.
3. No violations observed.
