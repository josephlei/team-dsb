HANDWASHING FACILITIES

OBSERVATIONS: Handwash sink was partially blocked by two bottles. Handwash sinks must always be accessible and fully
stocked with soap and paper towels so that handwashing by employees is made not only possible, but also likely. Corrected during
inspection.
- Note: It was recommended that the handwash sink be moved away from the corner as the current set up makes handwashing
difficult with the beverage gun tubing likely to block access to the sink.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Handwashing facilities shall be provided within or adjacent to toilet rooms, food preparation, and warewashing
areas. Handwashing facilities shall be clean, unobstructed, and accessible at all times. Handwashing facilities shall be provided with soap
and sanitary single-use towels or heated-air hand drying device in approved dispensers. Dispensers shall be maintained in good repair.

to the food handler. Thermometers shall be calibrated in accordance with manufacturer's specifications as necessary to ensure their
