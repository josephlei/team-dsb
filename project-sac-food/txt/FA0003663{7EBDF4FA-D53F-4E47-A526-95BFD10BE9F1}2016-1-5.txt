HOT AND COLD HOLDING TEMPERATURES

OBSERVATIONS: 1. Cooked rice on a shelf in the dish washing area, where staff says it will be re-cooked prior to service, at 67 deg.
F, cooked about 3.5 - 4 hours ago. The primary source of B. cereus foodborne illness is holding cooked grains out of correct
temperature, in the danger zone of 41 - 135.
Per Roger, the rice is cooked, then cooled at room temperature for up to 4 hours. Then it is re-cooked in a pot on the grill, with a
padded damp cloth covering the pot so the rice does not get soggy. These damp clothes are wrapping a flat "lid."
Due to the risk of Bacillus cereus, which can form spores, cooked rice must be held below 41 deg. F or above 135 deg. F. Correct
immediately.
2. REPEAT VIOLATION: Cubed beef in the walk in at 47 deg. F, beef roast in the walk in at 47 deg. F. All tested foods in the walk in
are 47 deg. F. This refrigeration unit must maintain food temperatures at or below 41 deg. F at all times, even when busy. Turn
refrigerator down or repair to maintain cold foods at or below 41 deg. within 2 days.
3. REPEAT VIOLATION: Feta cheese blocks are 48 deg. F in the prep refrigerator closest to the soda fountain. This product is again
overfilled. See previous notice where chef agreed to discontinue over filling foods starting 10/5/15.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be
held at or below 45F: raw shell eggs, unshucked live molluscan shellfish, pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products in original sealed
containers, potentially hazardous foods held during transportation. Food preparation shall not exceed two cumulative hours without a return to
the required holding temperatures. (113996, 113998, 114037)

# 27

FOOD PROTECTED FROM CONTAMINATION

OBSERVATIONS: Raw eggs are stored above ready-to-eat and lesser cooked foods. Raw beef is stored above 5 gallon sauces.
Keep raw animal/poultry products separate and below lesser cooked foods. Reorganize the freezer and refrigerator to
accommodate this requirement. Note: Freezer is so full that foods are blocking entry up to the top of the door and I was unable to
inspect this unit.
Correct within 2 days.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Food shall be protected from contamination during transportation, storage, preparation, holding, and display. Food
and condiments on display shall be protected from contamination by the use of dispensers, packaging, counter, service line, or sneeze guards
that intercept a direct line between the consumer's mouth and the food being displayed. Only prepackaged non-potentially hazardous food or
uncut produce may be displayed or sold outdoors if under overhead cover. Open-air barbecues shall be separated from public access.

# 30b

FOOD CONTAINERS LABELED

OBSERVATIONS: A few containers lack labels, observed a white powder in an open clear container on shelf with lemon juice
containers without a label. White powders are especially dangerous as both cleaning agents and spices/food products appear
alike. Label all food and cleaning/toxics containers when product is removed from labeled shipping container. Correct within 14
days.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Containers holding food or food ingredients that are removed from their original packaging shall be identified with the
common name of the food. (114051)
