FOOD PROTECTED FROM CONTAMINATION

OBSERVATIONS: Found container of blue berries stored uncovered in self-service area. Keep covered or provide self-closing lids
to prevent containers from being left open in between uses.
NOTE: Lids on these particular containers do not close properly if you do not pull them forward as you shut them. Item was
repeatedly left open due to its design. Recommend containers that self-close on their own for better overhead protection.
Found apples stored on a table near the front desk and inside a conference room adjacent to the buffet line uncovered. Provide
overhead protection at all times. Correct immediately

and condiments on display shall be protected from contamination by the use of dispensers, packaging, counter, service line, or sneeze guards
that intercept a direct line between the consumer's mouth and the food being displayed. Only prepackaged non-potentially hazardous food or
uncut produce may be displayed or sold outdoors if under overhead cover. Open-air barbecues shall be separated from public access.
