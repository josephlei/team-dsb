HANDWASHING FACILITIES

MAJOR

OBSERVATIONS: Duck was found being thawed under running water in the kitchen handwash sink. Do not use handwash sinks for
any other purpose; if you have to move something to be able to wash your hands, that hand sink is considered blocked. Handwash
sinks must always be accessible and fully stocked with soap and paper towels so that handwashing by employees is made not only
possible, but also likely. Corrected during the inspection.
Note: Per manager, they have been washing hands in the small sink at the end of the food prep island across from the cook's line.
While soap and paper towels may have been provided, this sink should not be used as a handwash sink until a metal splash guard
(with a height of at least 6 inches, the corners of the barrier to be rounded) is installed around the sides and back of the sink. Food
is currently being prepped and stored around this sink and must be protected from splashes when washing hands.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Handwashing facilities shall be provided within or adjacent to toilet rooms, food preparation, and warewashing
areas. Handwashing facilities shall be clean, unobstructed, and accessible at all times. Handwashing facilities shall be provided with soap
and sanitary single-use towels or heated-air hand drying device in approved dispensers. Dispensers shall be maintained in good repair.

OBSERVATIONS: Raw chicken, raw beef, raw pork and shrimps in open cold inserts at cook's line were measured from 43 to 49 F
using a thermocouple. Ambient air temperature inside the reach-in portion under the cold inserts was measured at 37 F. Ambient
air temperatures inside the reach-in portion of this refrigeration unit (under the inserts) were measured at 37 to 38 F. Inserts were
found not overfilled. Ambient air temperature above the inserts was measured at 88 F. A large lid was available for covering the
inserts but this was not being used regularly because of its size and weight. The option of using lids for individual inserts
containing potentially hazardous foods (PHF) was recommended to the manager. Food temperatures must be checked using a
probe thermometer frequently and regularly to ensure that these are at 41 F or below. Large lid was used to cover all the inserts
during the inspection.
- THIRD REPEAT VIOLATION - (Observed and written up during the last FOUR routine inspections)
* See important note about a mandatory reinspection in the Notes section below.
