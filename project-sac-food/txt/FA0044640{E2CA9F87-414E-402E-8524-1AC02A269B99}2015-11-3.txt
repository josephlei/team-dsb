WAREWASHING AND SANITIZING PROCEDURES

OBSERVATIONS: Quat. Ammonia at 150 ppm in the warewashing sink. A cover was soaking but dishes were NOT being washed
during the inspection. Sanitizer must measure 200 ppm QA prior to sanitizing.
CalCode requires 200 ppm quaternary ammonia to be used for manual sanitization. There is no exemption to this except section
114099.6 (c) which states that manual sanitization can be accomplished using “other methods approved by the enforcement
agency.” EMD does not accept manufacturer’s instructions but requires 200 ppm when using QA for sanitizers in food facilities.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Food-contact surfaces and multiservice utensils shall be effectively washed, rinsed, and sanitized to remove or
completely loosen soils by use of manual or mechanical methods. The temperature of the washing solution shall be maintained at least 100F
or at the temperature specified by the manufacturer's label. Manual sanitation shall be accomplished during the final rinse by contact with
solution containing 100 ppm available chlorine or 200 ppm quaternary ammonium. Mechanical sanitization shall be accomplished in the final
rinse by achieving a utensil surface temperature of 160F or by contact with solution containing 50 ppm available chlorine. After cleaning and
sanitizing, equipment and utensils shall be air dried. (114097, 114099.1, 114099.2, 114099.4, 114099.6, 114099.7, 114101 (b-d), 114105,
114109, 114111)

NONFOOD-CONTACT SURFACES CLEAN

OBSERVATIONS: Floor sink in the front draining the soda machine has some mold. Clean to ensure that it doesn't overflow.
Correct within 7 days.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Nonfood-contact surfaces of equipment shall be kept free of an accumulation of dust, dirt, food residue, and other
debris. Interior premises of a food facility shall be kept clean. (114115 (b), 114257)

# 41

PLUMBING FIXTURES AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION

OBSERVATIONS: A waste discharge/condensate pipe below the soda fountain is leaking. Repair leak within 30 days.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Steam tables, ice machines, ice bins, food preparation sinks, display cases, walk-in refrigeration units, and other
similar equipment that discharge liquid waste shall drain into a floor sink with an air gap or other approved type of receptor. Plumbing and
plumbing fixtures shall be maintained so as to prevent contamination, shall be kept clean, fully operative, and in good repair. The potable
water supply shall be protected with a backflow or back siphonage protection device. Any hose used for potable water shall be of approved
materials, labeled, properly stored, and used for no other purpose. (114171, 114190, 114192, 114193, 114193.1, 114199, 114201, 114269)
