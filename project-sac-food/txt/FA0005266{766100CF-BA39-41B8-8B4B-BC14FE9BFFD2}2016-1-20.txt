GARBAGE AND REFUSE DISPOSAL

OBSERVATIONS: Garbage dumpster just outside rear exit door was found with lids open. Always keep lids closed when not being
filled to prevent vermin infestation and possible dirty water (leachate) run-off to storm water drain. Corrected during the inspection.

CODE DESCRIPTION: The exterior premises of a food facility shall be kept free of litter and rubbish. All food waste and rubbish shall be
kept in nonabsorbent, durable, cleanable, leak-proof, and rodent-proof containers. Containers shall have close-fitting lids and be covered at
