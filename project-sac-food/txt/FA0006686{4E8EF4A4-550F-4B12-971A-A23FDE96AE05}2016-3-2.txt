NOTES

This reinspection was conducted to ensure compliance on violations observed and written up during the 3/1/2016 routine inspection.
No more food holding temperature violations were observed.
All handwash sinks were found accessible, fully-functional and stocked with soap and paper towels.
No more open foods vulnerable to contamination or adulteration were observed. Walk-in refrigerator and freezer condensers have not yet
been serviced/repaired but catch pans were found under the leaks.
It was pointed out to the operator that all the hot food items at the buffet line were all individually time stamped to be discarded at 6:00
PM. The operator agreed that that it is highly unlikely that all these items were all put out on the buffet line at the same time. A long
discussion was had with the operator on the necessity of better training employees on the correct way to implement time as a public
health control.
The operator was encouraged to voluntarily send his employees to the EMD Food School and he agreed to send them in batches.
Inspector will provide the operator with a schedule of Food School classes.
See above for minor violations still needing correction. Refer to 3/1/2016 routine inspection report for corrective actions and time frames
for correction.
