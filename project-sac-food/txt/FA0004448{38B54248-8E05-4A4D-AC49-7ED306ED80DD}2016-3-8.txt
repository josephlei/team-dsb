Items listed on this report as violations do not meet the requirements set forth in the California Health and Safety Code commencing with section 7; 113700.

EQUIPMENT APPROVED AND MAINTAINED

OBSERVATIONS: High temperature waremachine measured 139F after test cycles were ran and thermal labels did not register at
160F. CHRONIC REPEAT VIOLATION. Unit was not in use for high heat sanitization. Manually sanitize with 200ppm QA or 100ppm
Cl.
Due to chronic repeat violations since at least 11/15/13 and inconsistent temperature readings even after numerous repair attempts,
facility must discontinue use of the high temperature unit and either replace unit, switch to a low temperature waremachine or
utilize the 3-compartment sink. Note: It is highly recommended that facility switches to a low temperature waremachine solution.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Utensils and equipment shall be kept fully operative and in good repair. All new and replacement equipment shall be
properly installed and be certified by NSF, UL Sanitation, or ETL Sanitation. Facilities that wash, rinse, soak, thaw, or similarly prepare foods
shall be provided with a approved food preparation sink. Surfaces such as cutting blocks and boards that are subject to scratching and
scoring shall be resurfaced or replaced if they can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. (114130, 114130.1, 114130.2, 114130.3,

NOTES

Second reinspection conducted due to Conditional Passes issued on 3/4/16 and 3/7/16 for major food contact surfaces cleaned and
warewashing violations.
All major violations remain corrected.
-High temperature waremachine is only used for the first wash and rinse steps. Sanitizer was filled at the 2-compartment sink for manual
sanitization. Sanitizer measured at 200ppm QA.
-No cross contamination observed.
See #35. An additional reinspection ($268) will be conducted within 30 days to verify compliance with warewashing requirements. A
compliance conference with a fee of $402, will be scheduled if equipment is not properly sanitized due to use of the unreliable high
temperature machine during the next reinspections and future routine inspection.
