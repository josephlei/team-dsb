HOT AND COLD HOLDING TEMPERATURES

OBSERVATIONS: Raw ground pork in the True 3 door reach in (back area) measured 44 deg. F. Correct within 2 days. (This
refrigerator was very full with bus tubs of food which may inhibit circulation.)

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be
held at or below 45F: raw shell eggs, unshucked live molluscan shellfish, pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products in original sealed
containers, potentially hazardous foods held during transportation. Food preparation shall not exceed two cumulative hours without a return to
the required holding temperatures. (113996, 113998, 114037)

#9

COOLING METHODS

OBSERVATIONS: TPHC is used for cooling. Observed large amount of cooked pork, greater than 50 lbs, on the countertop cooling
with the TPHC label of 1:30 - 3:30. Room temperature is 75 deg. F. Current food product temp is 85-95 deg. F
Quickly cool to 70 deg. F within 2 hours. Leaving food on the counter in a room at 75 deg. F will not cool the food to below 75 deg.
F. THIS FOOD PRODUCT MUST MEET 70 DEG. F BY 3:30 TODAY OR BE DISCARDED.
Discontinue using TPHC to cool food at room temperature OR DISCARD food after the time stamp (3:30.) Place potentially
hazardous foods in a situation where they can cool from hot to 70 deg. or below within 2 hours, such as under refrigeration, in an
ice bath, in the refrigerator/freezer, etc.
See cooling handout. Correct immediately. Provided quick cooling sticker.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be rapidly cooled from 135F to 70F within 2 hours, and then from 70F to 41F within
4 hours. Cooling shall be by one or more of the following methods: in shallow containers, separating food into smaller portions, adding ice as
an ingredient, using an ice bath, stirring frequently, using rapid cooling equipment, or using containers that facilitate heat transfer. (114002,
114002.1)

NONFOOD-CONTACT SURFACES CLEAN

OBSERVATIONS: Attention to cleaning detail is lacking.
1. The floor behind and below some equipment, especially at the juncture of the wall where it's difficult to reach, has an
accumulation of grease/food debris. Clean and maintain within 7 days. Repeat violation.
2. Gaskets, door frames, equipment legs, handles on refrigerators, have an accumulation of food debris and grease. Clean and
maintain within 7 days. Repeat violation.
3. Food debris on the crates used to sit and place trays on are difficult to clean and are encrusted with food and grease. Hands
contact these crates. Routinely wash, rinse and sanitize crates or replace with cleanable equipment within 3 days. Repeat violation.
4. Smears of food on the walls and spills are not cleaned up when they occur, leaving walls and surfaces dirty. Clean as you go to
prevent accumulation of food and debris.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Nonfood-contact surfaces of equipment shall be kept free of an accumulation of dust, dirt, food residue, and other
debris. Interior premises of a food facility shall be kept clean. (114115 (b), 114257)

Routine

Items listed on this report as violations do not meet the requirements set forth in the California Health and Safety Code commencing with section 7; 113700.
All violations must be corrected within specified timeframe. Violations that are classified as "Major" pose an immediate threat to public health and have the
potential to cause foodborne illness. All major violations must be corrected immediately. Non-compliance may warrant immediate closure of the food facility.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Utensils and equipment shall be kept fully operative and in good repair. All new and replacement equipment shall be
properly installed and be certified by NSF, UL Sanitation, or ETL Sanitation. Facilities that wash, rinse, soak, thaw, or similarly prepare foods
shall be provided with a approved food preparation sink. Surfaces such as cutting blocks and boards that are subject to scratching and
scoring shall be resurfaced or replaced if they can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. (114130, 114130.1, 114130.2, 114130.3,
114130.4, 114130.5, 114130.6, 114132, 114133, 114137, 114139, 114153, 114163, 114165, 114169, 114175, 114177, 114180)

# 41

PLUMBING FIXTURES AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION

OBSERVATIONS: Mop sink has a faucet vacuum pressure breaker (anti-siphon device) and has a hose with a nozzle that has a
controller on the end to turn water off and on. This can place undetected pressure on the vacuum pressure breaker and cause it to
fail, undetected and allow wastewater to enter the potable water stream in your building. Provide approved anti-siphon OR remove
hose after each use. Correct within 7 days. Repeat violation. See handouts from inspection 11/19/15.

CODE DESCRIPTION: Steam tables, ice machines, ice bins, food preparation sinks, display cases, walk-in refrigeration units, and other
similar equipment that discharge liquid waste shall drain into a floor sink with an air gap or other approved type of receptor. Plumbing and
plumbing fixtures shall be maintained so as to prevent contamination, shall be kept clean, fully operative, and in good repair. The potable
water supply shall be protected with a backflow or back siphonage protection device. Any hose used for potable water shall be of approved
materials, labeled, properly stored, and used for no other purpose. (114171, 114190, 114192, 114193, 114193.1, 114199, 114201, 114269)

# 42

GARBAGE AND REFUSE DISPOSAL

OBSERVATIONS: Garbage bins are open. This facility shares the garbage area with other restaurants and the garbage company
routinely places bins in the enclosure with the lids trapped between the walls of the enclosure and the bins, making closure
impossible.
Contact Brett, supervisor of garbage company at 631-0600 if this continues to be a problem. This has been noted on the other
restaurant inspections.
Correct within 2 days.

CODE DESCRIPTION: The exterior premises of a food facility shall be kept free of litter and rubbish. All food waste and rubbish shall be kept
in nonabsorbent, durable, cleanable, leak-proof, and rodent-proof containers. Containers shall have close-fitting lids and be covered at all
times. All waste must be removed and disposed of as frequently as necessary to prevent the development of objectionable odors and other
conditions that attract or harbor insects or rodents. (114244, 114245, 114245.1, 114245.2, 114245.3, 114245.4, 114245.5, 114245.6,

NOTES

Observed cooked shrimp on 5 trays in the back, at 75 deg. F with time stamp for TPHC of 12:00 to 4:00. Per owner, these will be used for
dinner. (After talking to Sonia, the owner said that these will not be used after 4:00 p.m. and appeared to understand.) This may be
improper use of TPHC. Food must be DISCARDED/THROWN AWAY after the time on the time stamp and not refrigerated or used.
Observed fried shrimp added to the bulk fried shrimp in the broken chef prep top, where TPHC is used (product 54 deg. F). This was
stamped 12:00 to 4:00. Do not add product to the top of time-tracked food unless you will DISCARD ALL product when time is up.
See #9 above for other questionable TPHC activities.
Provide TPHC handout.
