## Project Information

### Project Name

Sac County Open Data Set Aggregator

### Project Description

On the front facing data.saccounty.net website, datasets are displayed 25 at a time by most recently updated.
However, additional sort options and info about the datasets cannot be accessed unless you click on each one to "drill down." 

I wrote a simple python program to access the Open Data via API to retrieve the complete list of dataset names and descriptive info in one place.
This enables sorting, filtering and a one stop shop view of all data on the Sacramento Open Data Portal.

So far the program is in black and white, so it's 508A compliant too! :D
